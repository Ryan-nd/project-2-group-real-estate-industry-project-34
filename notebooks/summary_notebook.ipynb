    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, our group aims to predict rental prices for residential properties and apartments across Victoria, Australia. The primary objective is to investigate the influence of both internal and external factors on rental prices, while identifying properties most likely to see rent increases over the next five years. Internal variables such as the number of bedrooms will be examined alongside external factors like proximity to schools, transport, and population demographics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our group will scrape data from property listing websites, such as Domain, and utilize external datasets to perform analysis and this analysis will provide insights into:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Key features influencing rental price predictions.\n",
    "2. Top 10 suburbs with the highest expected rent growth.\n",
    "3. Most liveable and affordable suburbs according to defined metrics.\n",

    "# Our Aim: \n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, our group aims to assist Purpose Built Student Accommodation (PBSA) providers in identifying new locations for rental developments, especially as changes in international student caps from 2025 onwards will incentivize further construction of PBSAs. \n",
    "\n",
    "With temporary higher education visa holders accounting for 33.9% of net overseas migration in FY 2022-23, the demand for student housing has significantly increased. Currently, PBSAs provide accommodation for over 76,500 students as of May 2022, but there is still unmet demand for more student housing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our analysis will focus on identifying the optimal locations for PBSA developments, ensuring they are positioned to meet the needs of international students and maximize growth potential in the rental market.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project will leverage both geospatial data and rental market trends to ensure PBSA developers are equipped with the insights needed to make strategic decisions for future growth.\n"

    "## Datasets Used\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) Income Data**  \n",
    "   - *Files*:  \n",
    "     - `ABS_Income_including_government_allowances_by_2021_SA2_Nov_2023.csv`\n",
    "     - `au-govt-abs-abs-data-by-region-income-asgs-sa2-2011-2019-sa2-2016.csv`  \n",
    "   - These files provide regional income data, including government allowances, which are critical for understanding the financial landscape of different SA2 regions across Australia.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Demographic Data from ABS**  \n",
    "   - *File*:  \n",
    "     - `33010DO002_2022_ST_AUST.xlsx`  \n",
    "   - This dataset provides population and fertility data, which we use to project population growth and future housing demand, especially relevant for student accommodations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Geospatial Data (Shapefiles)**  \n",
    "   - *File*:  \n",
    "     - `SA2_2021_AUST_GDA2020.shp`  \n",
    "   - This shapefile contains geographic boundary data for Statistical Areas Level 2 (SA2). It allows us to map our data spatially and perform location-based analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Crime Data**  \n",
    "   - *Source*:  \n",
    "     - Crime data obtained from [Crime Statistics Agency, Victoria](https://www.crimestatistics.vic.gov.au/crime-statistics/latest-victorian-crime-data/download-data)  \n",
    "   - This dataset is used to analyze the impact of crime on rental prices and livability in different regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Rental Data**  \n",
    "   - *Source*:  \n",
    "     - Scraped from domain.com.au  \n",
    "   - Rental data is collected through web scraping efforts to gather information on current rental prices, property attributes, and availability.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Preprocessing Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Each dataset underwent its own preprocessing steps to ensure that the data was ready for analysis. The preprocessing steps included tasks such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cleaning**: Removing any missing or invalid data entries.\n",
    "- **Transformation**: Standardizing units and formats for consistency.\n",
    "- **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features such as distance to the nearest transportation, proximity to schools, or calculating rent price per square meter.\n",
    "- **Merging**: Combining multiple datasets (e.g., income data, demographic data, and rental data) based on SA2 regions for a comprehensive analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The detailed preprocessing steps can be found in their respective notebooks within the project repository.\n"

    "2. **Model Tuning**: We applied **GridSearchCV** to perform hyperparameter tuning on the RandomForestRegressor. This involved searching across various hyperparameters to find the best combination that minimized the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). A predefined split was used to ensure consistent evaluation.\n",
    "3. **Cross-Validation**: A predefined cross-validation strategy was employed to evaluate the model's performance on the training and test sets across different runs, ensuring robustness.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Model and Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "After multiple runs and hyperparameter tuning, the best parameters for the RandomForestRegressor were selected based on the lowest RMSE score. The best model demonstrated strong performance, with a significant reduction in prediction error compared to baseline models.\n",

    "## Feature Importance\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the Random Forest model, we identified the most important features that contribute to predicting rental prices. The model's feature importance scores help us understand which variables have the greatest impact on rental price predictions. Below are the key features and their relative importance:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **bed_bath_interaction**: The interaction between the number of bedrooms and bathrooms proved to be the most important feature. This interaction captures the combined effect of these two factors, which strongly influence the overall price.\n",
    "- **bathrooms**: The number of bathrooms directly impacts the perceived value of the property, making it a critical determinant of rental prices.\n",
    "- **date_numeric**: The time factor, represented as a numeric value, also plays a significant role in predicting price trends, capturing temporal changes in the market.\n",
    "- **bedrooms**: Similar to bathrooms, the number of bedrooms is another key internal feature that significantly affects rental pricing.\n",
    "- **distance_to_CBD**: Proximity to the Central Business District (CBD) is an external feature that greatly influences the desirability and price of a property.\n",
    "- **distance_to_tram_stop**: Being located near a tram stop adds convenience and increases the rental value of a property.\n",
    "- **distance_to_uni**: The closer a property is to universities, the more desirable it becomes for students, driving up rental prices.\n",
    "- **SA2_CODE21**: This feature represents the geographic SA2 regions, accounting for location-based factors that impact rent.\n",
    "- **Income (Median)**: Median income levels in the area contribute to pricing decisions, as more affluent areas can sustain higher rental rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other features such as **carspaces**, **distance to public transport (train, bus)**, and **proximity to malls or supermarkets** also play a role but are less important compared to the top factors listed above.\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis helps us understand that both internal property attributes (e.g., bedrooms, bathrooms) and external location-based factors (e.g., distance to CBD and transport hubs) are crucial in determining rental prices. The Random Forest model effectively highlights the relative importance of these features.\n"

    "## Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "While the individual data points and models provide valuable insights, it's when they are put together that we can make informed, strategic recommendations for your next development project. Based on our analysis, we have crafted some specific recommendations that we believe could be highly beneficial in choosing the location of your next development.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Targeting the Lifestyle-Oriented Market\n",
    "\n",
    "If your focus is on attracting a **lifestyle-oriented market**, we recommend considering areas such as **North Melbourne** and **Docklands**. Our models indicate that both of these areas rank in the top 10 for projected rental growth, and North Melbourne is also in the top 10 for both **demand** and **liveability**. While Docklands falls just outside the top 10 in some of these categories, it still presents a strong opportunity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although both areas are intriguing, we would **lean towards North Melbourne** due to its stronger performance in demand and liveability metrics, making it an ideal target for new developments aimed at young professionals and families seeking a balanced lifestyle close to the city.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Build-to-Rent Opportunity\n",
    "\n",
    "As you consider your next project, a key question might be whether to develop a **build-for-sale** or **build-to-rent (BTR)** property. We encourage you to diversify your portfolio by strongly considering a **build-to-rent** development. Melbourne has seen several successful BTR projects in recent years, including:\n",
    "- **Liv Munro**\n",
    "- **Liv Aston**\n",
    "- **Home**\n",
    "- **Platinum Apartments**\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these are located close to the CBD, and there is a **huge opportunity** to develop something similar in **Docklands** or **North Melbourne**, where there is still untapped potential. Building a BTR development in these areas allows you to establish a project before your competitors, securing a first-mover advantage.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constant Demand from Renters\n",
    "\n",
    "The presence of **students** and **young professionals** in these areas bodes well for maintaining a constant influx of renters. With students frequently looking for rental options and young professionals increasingly renting due to difficulties in obtaining a mortgage, the demand for rental properties is expected to remain strong. This makes areas like North Melbourne and Docklands ideal for long-term investments in rental properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Build-to-Rent?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **BTR development** not only attracts renters but also offers the advantage of providing a **constant income stream**, unlike traditional build-for-sale projects that generate one-off sales. This approach diversifies a developer's portfolio and creates a more sustainable, recurring revenue model. With rising demand for rental properties and limited competition in BTR developments in these areas, the time is right to capitalize on this opportunity.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, based on our data-driven analysis, **North Melbourne** and **Docklands** present prime opportunities for your next **lifestyle-oriented** and **build-to-rent** development, ensuring both high demand and long-term growth potential.\n"
