    "\n",
    "In addition to predicting future crime rates (2025, 2026, and 2027), we also performed **backward prediction** to estimate crime rates for past years (2014, 2013, 2012, and 2011). This method helps validate the model by allowing us to compare the predicted crime rates with actual data for these past years and assess the accuracy of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "To perform backward prediction, we used future data to predict the crime rate for each earlier year. For example, to predict the crime rate for 2014, we trained the model using data from 2015 through 2019. This rolling window of future data is used to simulate predicting earlier years.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we defined a list of target years for backward prediction (`2014, 2013, 2012, 2011`) and created training windows for each year, using data from the subsequent 5 years. For instance, when predicting the 2014 crime rate, the model was trained on data from 2015-2019. For each year, we ensured that sufficient future data existed, i.e., 5 years of data, before proceeding.\n",
    "\n",
    "We initialized a **RandomForestRegressor** model with 200 estimators and trained it on the crime data from the future years. The input features (`X`) were the crime rates for the next 5 years, and the target variable (`y`) was the crime rate for the last year of the window (e.g., 2019). After training the model, we predicted the crime rate for the target year and stored the predicted values as a new column in the dataset for that specific year.\n",
    "\n",
    "Backward prediction allows us to validate the model by comparing the predicted values with actual crime data. This approach helps evaluate how well the model generalizes across different time periods and captures the trends in crime rates. By testing the model on historical data, we can refine its parameters and improve its robustness for future predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, backward prediction is a powerful tool for validating the model, ensuring that it not only predicts future trends but also accurately captures patterns in past data. This strengthens the model's ability to forecast future crime rates and provides a more reliable framework for decision-making.\n"
